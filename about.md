Hello there! Welcome to my blog, your central repository of notes on all things Data, Math, and Applied Machine Learning.
I'm thrilled to have you here! Allow me to introduce myself.
</p>
<p>
I'm a passionate problem solver and a dedicated Teamlead Data Science at avantum consult GmbH. With my PhD from TU Munich,
I've delved into the world of applied machine learning in energy informatics, exploring innovative solutions to real-world challenges.
I take pride in pushing forward Data Science related topics and actively engaging in product development at my current job.
</p>
<p>
But that's not all there is to me. I'm also a proud father of two and a happily married guy.
As I navigate through the ever-evolving jungle of machine learning, I strive to share my insights with you, my readers.
If you come across any errors or have suggestions, I'm more than happy to fix them.
After all, my utmost goal is to share with you the invaluable insights I've gained along my own learning journey,
in order to facilitate and enhance your own exploration of these captivating realms!
</p>
<p>
Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the fascinating world of data, math, and applied machine learning together.
Let's learn, grow, and make a positive impact with software solutions that truly make a difference.
I hope my experiences and insights will be helpful to you as well. Thanks for visiting my blog :)
