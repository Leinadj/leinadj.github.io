# About me

What is there you need to know about me?
First of all, I started this blog as a central repository of my notes on a variety of topics around Data & Math & Applied Machine Learning - so if there are any errors, etc. please let me know :) I'll be happy to fix them!

Currently, I am Teamlead Data Science at avantum consult GmbH and I am pushing forward all Data Science related topics.
I got my PhD by TU Munich by dwelling on applied machine learning problems in energy informatics.
I like to solve problems, and build software solutions that benefit the world - that's why I also love enganging in product development at my current job

But most importantly: I am a proud father of two and a happily married guy - that tries to navigate through the whole machine learning jungle as good as he can :) 
And I hope some of my insights will help you too!
